**About:**

Behance does not allow any curl, wget, phantom js or other things to pass through their security. 
This is a good realisation of real simulation of user activity ( views, likes) over proxy.

This script uses Portable Google Chrome, imacros plugin and bats files in order to handle all process.
It is designed to make unlimited likes over proxy on behance ( and views).


**Files:**

single.bat- allows to start single call for website and put like getting proxy as argument from starter.bat

starter.bat - starts single.bat with proxy argument, should be created from table.xlsx

table.xlsx - Example of filled table = starter.bat after rename

1,2,3,4.html - File which includes macro for js for pushing button on website

**Setup:**

Navigate to 1.html (1,2,3,4.html) and change line 8 on desired and line 6 in every html file.

Go to table.xlsx and fill it with proxy list creating bat file out of it ( convinient way).


**Options:**
Using -n we get time + little random, change it depending on proxy speed.
Make sure you killing chrome right after it finished job.
--cookie=NAME=VALUE can be added if you have accounts. Add their cookies if you wish

**Testing:**
If you would like to see how it works just press single.bat and you will see how it works.

**HARM:**
Using this tool you can cause harm to you or your competitor - you can ban yours or his profile.
You are not young man, think twice before doing any illigal activity.

**Using other websites to do same things:**

If you wish to make VIEWS and clicks on other websites like facebook or something other - use imacros plugin to record your like or action and replace it on html line 6 and 7. It will do its job like it does with behance. As long as imacros does not allow to abuse it really bad - only one line is allowed in this case. Buy commercial one in order to use more if you wish.

**Warning from Behance**!

D*ear User,

****This is an automated message. Please do not reply.****
Hello,
It has been brought to our attention that you have been repeatedly using Automated Software to boost Appreciations/Views on your projects.
Please familiarize yourself with Behance community guidelines (https://www.behance.net/misc/community) and take notice what Automated or scripted behaviour is.
Behance is a platform for creative professionals to interact genuinely with one another. To maintain the quality of these interactions, we remove accounts that engage in behavior that undermines the authenticity of our community, including accounts that use fake profiles (to artificially increase appreciations or distribute spam), impersonate other people or entities, post false employment information, or use automated or scripted processes (such as bulk or automated following or appreciating user accounts, scripted commenting on projects, etc.). 
For similar reasons, we also suspend any accounts that accept (or offer) compensation in exchange for positive comments or appreciations. 
If you do not cease and will continue to abuse any features to boost the views and/or appretiations on your projects in the future we will be pressed to suspend or delete your Behance account.
